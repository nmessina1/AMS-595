Python Project #2 Documentation

2. Implementing Gradient Descent Algorithm
This problem finds the gradient descent of the function f(x) = sqrt(x**2 +5) and plots it over the 
interval [-5,5]. This is first plotted witout the minumum, and then once more with the minimum
once we find the gradient
X_T = 1.1159022395930293e-12

We also plot the values of f(xk) against the iteration number k

Finally, we plot the values f(x_k-1)-f(k) for each step size: 5,3,1, and 0.5 against iteration number k.

3. Linear Regression with Numpy and Graphing with Matplotlib
Here we use randomly generated data to perform a 2D linear regression, and plot the results
along with the regression plane in 3D. The random seed is set to 38 to represent the last
2 digits of my SBU ID

Intercept and Coefficients are reported:
Intercept: 3.7066788
Coefficients: [0.66633, 4.23992]

4. Logistic Regression with Numpy and Gaphing with Matplotlib
Here the learning rate and number of epochs are tuned to the following:
learning_rate = 1
num_epochs = 300
Comments are added for explanation and readability

5. Image Binary Classification
5a. code covered in class is re-implemented 
5b. Incorrect Predictions are reported.
The indices of the incorrect predictions are: [6, 10, 11, 13, 18, 19, 24, 28, 29, 30, 34, 41, 44, 45, 46]
4 of these are reported with images and predicted values
5c. Training data is set to first 168 images of training data set, the remaining 40 images
in this training set are used as the test data
Incorrect Predictions are recorded
The indices of the incorrect predictions are: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 19, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 35, 36, 38]
4 of these are reported with images and predicted values
