Q1. Approximating Pi

Uses files pi_approx.cpp

uses the formulas given in the question to approximate the value of Pi in a function called Pi_approx
A struct called PiResults is used here so that we can return both the approximation and the error of Pi

Q2. Dynamic Memory, Pointers, and Arrays

uses files approximations.cpp 

creates a function called approximations to intake a vector, and approximate Pi using each integer in the vector.
This is stored dynamically using pointers and malloc

Q3. Header Files and Makefiles

uses makefile, HW2main.cpp, pi_approx.h, approximations.h

In HW2main.cpp we call our PiResults struct, and the pi_approx function from Q1 to print out 
the approximation and error for Pi when N=10000
The output of this when the makefile is run is:
	Using Q1, here is Pi approximation and error for N = 10000
	Approximation: 3.14159
	Absolute Error: 1.17598e-06

Then we create a vector called powersof10 to give us an array with the elements (10^1,...,10^7).
This array is used as the argument for the approximations function from Q2.
The output of this when the makefile is run is:
	3.10452
	3.14042
	3.14156
	3.14159
	3.14159
	3.14159
	3.14159
