Documentation for Python HW #1

1. This transforms the matlab switch statement to a Python if-elif-else statement.
Using an input, the code will tell you if this input is negative one, zero, positive one, 
or some other integer.

2. This code uses a while loop to give you the factorial of a positive integer.
While n-1 is greater than 0, we will continuously multiply the input n by n-1.

3. A function to determine if a number is prime. We know a number is prime if it is divisible
by a number other than itself and 1. So we use a for loop in our function to go through all
numbers smaller than n, and check if n is divisible by it. If so, we return false. If n is 
not divisible by any number > 1, and exlcuding itself, then it is prime.

4. This code uses list comprehension to return prime factors of a number. Using the is_prime funciton
from the previous question, we check every factor of n. If is_prime returns true, and the
number is divisible by n, then we add it to our list output.

5. Here we write a function to get the nth row of Pascal's triangle, both through recursion
and through loops.
In the recursion we reference the function itelf in order to get our previous row. Then we 
iterate through the previous row, adding the elements to the numbers for the next row. 
We always append a 1 at the end of each row.

For the while/for loop not using recursion, we iterate while our counter variable is less than 
n. We use similar logic from the recursion in order get the elements for the current row.
Then we set our previous row to equal our current row at the end of each loop. This replaces
our recursion from the first part of the question.
