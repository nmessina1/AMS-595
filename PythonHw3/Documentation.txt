Python Homework #3 Documentation

2a. Numerical Integration
This problem first uses Sympy to solve a definite integral, and then uses a numpy function to approximate the function 
using the trapezoid rule scheme over multiple values of N

3. Pandas I
This problem created a pandas dataframe, and demonstrates adding a column.

4. Pandas II
This problem uses pandas to display a dataframe from an excel file, sorts the data, and demonstrates indexing a dataframe

5. LU Decomposition
This problem uses gaussian elimination to take an input matrix A, and return 2 matrices L and U such that L*U = A
Bonus:
The bonus uses a pivoting function to output a pivot matrix P such that P*A = L*U

6. Markov Chain
This problem performs a Markov chain transition using a matrix P on a set of n states.
A 5x5 matrix is set and normalized 
The transition rule is applied 50 times and the eigenvector is computed
the component wise difference between p50 and the stationary distribution is computed, 
they all match within 1e-5
